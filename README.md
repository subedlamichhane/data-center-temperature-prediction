Using Artificial Neural Network to solve linear regression between inlet temperature and Power dissipation from the server equipments given by heat recirculation model
𝑇𝑖𝑛 =𝑇𝑠𝑢𝑝 +𝐻 ∗𝑃 

Two distribution of P: Uniform random and random normal  are used to train validate and test 
2 layer of fully connected ANN with 128 units gave the best results.
